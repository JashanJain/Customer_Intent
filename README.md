# 🤖 Intent Prediction Model

An NLP-based intent classification system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. This project predicts user intent from text input with high accuracy.

## 📋 Overview

This project uses deep learning to classify text into different intent categories. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras and deployed as a web application for easy interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- **LSTM-based Model**: Deep learning architecture for accurate intent classification
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant intent detection from user input
- **Confidence Scores**: Displays prediction confidence for transparency
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for testing the model
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes tokenization and label encoding
